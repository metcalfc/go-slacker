# go slacker
This is an implementation of a command line tool I use to manage my Slack status. AKA Slacker in Go. No reason for it to be in Go other then I was looking for something to write.

# slacker in bash

Thanks to the awesome magic that is https://github.com/rockymadden/slack-cli I can already do all of this in bash. If you'd like to see something that already works head over to: https://github.com/metcalfc/slacker-bash AKA Slacker in bash.

# Disclaimer

This does not do anything right now. Itâ€™s a fun time project. If you would like to play along you will need:
  - Docker
  - Go (1.11 or newer)
  - Go Releaser (https://goreleaser.com/install/)
  - Make

# Building

```
make snapshot
```
